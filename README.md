# OZ_project:
The Oz Report will relay tornado and weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API and information from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): a csv download of 500 tornadic event details from 11/01/2019 to 11/30/2020. The report will utilize HTML, CSS, Javascript and a created SQL database. The report will include visualizations utilizing D3.js and Leaflet Heatmap, as well as a background image using Multiple.js. The D3.js visualization will be an interactive scatter plot and allow users to see tornado magnitude, F scale, resulting damage, injuries, and deaths. Leaflet Heatmap will display tornado width and location. Inspiration for Project Oz comes from the current Tornado Safety Week.
