# OZ_project:
This Oz report will relay Tornado and weather information using OpenWeatherMap API and information from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) csv download of 500 tornadic event details from 11/01/2019 to 11/30/2020. The report will utilize HTML, CSS, Javascript and a created SQL database. The report will include visualizations utilizing D3.js and Leaflet Heatmap, as well as a background image using Multiple.js. The d3 visualization will be interactive scatter plot and allow user to see choice of Tornado Magnitude or F scale and resulting Damage, Injuries or Deaths. Leaflet Heatmap will display tornado width and location. Inspiration for Project Oz comes from the current Tornado Safety Week.
